\section{Introduction}
Motivation to this work was to distinguish a periodic behavior of 
potential threats from ordinary network communication. Example dataset
provided for this purposes contains a samples of communication of the 
unknown mallware along with the ordinary network communication.
Mallware has been periodically (interval of 10 seconds) sending 
small amount of data to one concrete host.

For the purpose of this work only few of the network communication 
participants was analysed as most of the traffic was not known.
Endpoint token in consideration are proxy server, host attacked by mallware
the mallware`s target (server) and host with ordinary web usage (it cannot be
considered as an legitimus).

\section{Definitions}
\subsection{Network traffic, gathering the data}
Network traffic can be represented by set of flows distributed in time.
The flow is a sequence of packets, that has similar attributes. Packets
are exchanged usually among network endpoints. Attributes
under consderation are at least: source and destination endpoint address, port and
protocol. These are used to delimitate flows.

In order to evaluate anomaly rate of paticular flow other properties ought to be
taken in account. Especially number of packets and bytes, starting or ending time
(timestamp of the first or the last packet in the flow).

%TODO mention the features 
The time distribution of flows can be determined by considering the
starting timestamp of each flow. This approach provides generalized view on the flow, 
as it has been occured in network channel with unlimited throughput.

Experimental dataset provided for the research has been extended with
classification information, a knowledge that particular endpoint is 
harmfull or not or even if it is potetionaly harmfull.

\subsection{Data binning}
In order to reduce minor observation errors binning technique ought to be used.
The time axis is divided into disjoint intervals - bins.
Let $h$ be number of bins and $\mathbb{F}$ be the set of all flows captured in time interval
$\mathbb{T} = (0, T_{max}\rangle $. The $t$-th bin is known as 
set of flows $\mathbb{F}_t$ 
that occurs in time interval
$\mathbb{T}_t = ((t-1)\cdot \delta, t\cdot \delta\rangle $ where 
$t \in \{1, .. h\}$ and $\delta$ is the width of time intervals
denoted $\delta = \frac{T_{max}}{h}$.
Denote
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{F}_t = \{f : f \in \mathbb{F} \wedge s(f) \in \mathbb{T}_t \}
\end{equation}
where function $s:\mathbb{F} \rightarrow \mathbb{N} $ 
outputs starting timestamp of the flow $f\in \mathbb{F}$.

For each interval,
representative value is calculated. Following formulas have been considered:
\begin{equation}
r_t^{(1)} = \frac{\sum\limits_{f\in \mathbb{F}_t}b(f)}{\sum\limits_{f\in \mathbb{F}_t}p(f)}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
r_t^{(2)} = \log(1+\sum\limits_{f\in \mathbb{F}_t}p(f))
\end{equation}
where $r_t$ is representative of time interval $t$, $\mathbb{F}_t$ is set of flows captured in time 
interval $t$, function $b:\mathbb{F} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ outputs size of the flow $f$ in bytes and function 
$p:\mathbb{F} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ outputs the packet count of the flow $f$.

%TODO further description of representatives and features

\subsection{Fourier transformation}
Representatives ($r_t$) are subject to transformation from the time domain to the
frequency domain.
This can be achieved by fourier-related
tranforms, e.g. by a fourier or a wavelet transform.
The wavelet transform, unlike the fourier transform, captures
not only a notion of the frequency content of the input, by
examining it at different scales, but also temporal content.

To achieve fast computation, a fast fourier transform (FFT) algorithm 
has been involved.
It is an efficient algorithm to compute the discrete fourier tranform (DFT) and
its inverse.
A DFT decomposes a sequence of values into components of
different frequencies. 
This operation is useful in many fields but computing it directly from the
definition is often too slow to be practical.
An FFT is a way to compute the same result more quickly: 
computing a DFT of N points in the naive way, using the definition, takes
$O(N^2$) arithmetical operations, 
while an FFT can compute the same result in only $ O(N \log N)$ operations.

The sequence of $N$ complex numbers $x_0, ..., x_{N−1}$ is transformed into the
sequence of $N$ complex numbers $X_0, ..., X_{N−1}$ by the DFT according to the
formula:
\begin{equation}
X_k = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n e^{-\frac{2 \pi i}{N} k n} \quad \quad k = 0, \dots, N-1
\end{equation}
where $i$ is imaginary unit and $e^{-\frac{2 \pi i}{N} k n}$ is $N$-th root of
unity. 

The transform is sometimes denoted as 
$\mathcal{F}\colon\mathbb{C}^N \to \mathbb{C}^N$, e.g.
$\mathbf{X} = \mathcal{F} \left ( \mathbf{x} \right )$.

Before processing the fourier transform, the sequence of representatives 
$r_1, ...,r_h$ is choped into overlaping slices.
Each slice (sequence $r_a, ..., r_b$, where $a$ and $b$ are boundaries
of particular slice) is then transformed by means of fourier transformation,
resulting in sequence of complex coeficients for each slice,
and by discarding phase information real coeficients ${R}_i$ are obtained,
where $i = 0, ..., b-a-1$.

Slices are ordered as they are occuring in time and they ought to be numbered
$j = 1,..., g $. The count of slices $g$ depends on the number of elements $h$
in input sequence, on the slice size $w$ and the step size $s$.
For the sake of convenience the slice size $w$ is power of two.
Let $a_j$ and $b_j$ be the boundaries of the $j$-th slice. Then
$a_1 = 1$, $b_j = a_j + w$ and $a_{j+1} = a_j + s$.
For the overlaping slices inequality $s < w$ is valid.
Proper values of $s$ and $w$ are subject to research.

Let $\mathcal{R}$ be matrix of fourier coeficients where
$\mathcal{R}_{i,j}$ is $i$-th fourier coeficient of $j$-th slice,
i.e. 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{R}_{*,j} = abs(\mathcal{F}(r_{a_j}, ..., r_{b_j}))
\end{equation}
The row $\mathcal{R}_{i,*}$ represents a trend of $i$-th fourier
coeficient in time.

\subsection{Distinguishing the endpoints}
As mentioned above experimental dataset contains also
classification information pointing out an level of anomaly of 
particular endpoints. Endpoint is determined by its address.
We now extend the definitions mentioned
former in order to be able to distinct the fourier coeficients for
particular endpoint.

Let $\mathbb{E}$ be a set of all endpoints that
participate in coummunication within time interval $\mathbb{T}$.
Let $\mathbb{F}_{t,u \rightarrow}$ be the set of flows captured in
time interval $\mathbb{T}_{t}$ %TODO: refer
which are \textbf{initiated} by the endpoint $u \in \mathbb{E}$,
similarly $\mathbb{F}_{t, \rightarrow u}$ are \textbf{ended} at the
endpoint $u$. Formaly

\begin{equation}
\mathbb{F}_{t,u \rightarrow} = \{f : f \in \mathbb{F} \wedge e_{s}(f) = u \wedge s(f) \in \mathbb{T}_t \}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{F}_{t, \rightarrow u} = \{f : f \in \mathbb{F} \wedge e_{d}(f) = u \wedge s(f) \in \mathbb{T}_t \}
\end{equation}
where $e_{s}:\mathbb{F}\rightarrow \mathbb{E}$ and
$e_{d}:\mathbb{F}\rightarrow \mathbb{E}$ 
are functions returning source and destination endpoint for the 
flow $f$.
The representative value of particular bin for particular endpoint is 
then:
\begin{equation}\label{bigrepr1}
r_{t,e}^{(1)} = \frac{\sum\limits_{f\in \mathbb{F}_{t,e}}b(f)}{\sum\limits_{f\in \mathbb{F}_{t,e}}p(f)}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{bigrepr2}
r_{t,e}^{(2)} = \log(1+\sum\limits_{f\in \mathbb{F}_{t,e}}p(f))
\end{equation}
where index ${}_e$ is replaces symbols ${}_{u\rightarrow}$ or 
${}_{\rightarrow u}$ from previous definition. So it is distinguished 
if the connection is initiated by the endpoint $u$, or ended at the
endpoint $u$.

Matrix of fourier coeficients $\mathcal{R}^\bullet$ is 3-dimensional:
\begin{equation}\label{bigmatrix}
\mathcal{R}^\bullet_{*,j,e} = abs(\mathcal{F}(r_{a_j,e}, ..., r_{b_j,e}))
\end{equation}
First dimension is related to the frequency domain, second to the time domain 
(this is the trend of the fourier coeficients over time), 
and third dimension is related to the endpoint.
We can denote that matrix $\mathcal{R}^{(1)\bullet}$ (resp. $\mathcal{R}^{(2)\bullet}$)
is using representative $r_{t,*}^{(1)}$ (resp. $r_{t,*}^{(2)}$) based on formulas
(\ref{bigrepr1}) and (\ref{bigrepr2}).

\section{Experiments}
Main task is to find an property of the frequency spectrum so that the malicious behavior
can be distinguished. Matrix $\mathcal{R}^\bullet$ provides trend of the frequency spectrum
in time domain for particular endpoint.
Following parameters has been choosen empiricaly:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|rl}
width of bins & $\delta =$ & $1$ sec \\ \hline
slice width & $w =$ & $128$ \\ \hline
slicing step & $s=$ & $40$ \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Size of the resulting matrix $\mathcal{R}^\bullet$ is then
$[w\times g\times \lvert\mathbb{E}\rvert]$, where $w=128$, $g=\lfloor\frac{h-w}{s} \rfloor$, 
$h = \lfloor\frac{T_{max}}{\delta}\rfloor$ and $\lvert\mathbb{E}\rvert $ is the number of the 
considered endpoints.

\subsection{Measurements}
The figures \ref{fig:spect_dst_bdivp},
\ref{fig:spect_src_bdivp}, \ref{fig:spect_dst_logp} and \ref{fig:spect_src_logp} are 
showing an mean value of the fourier coeficients along with a standard deviation.
The blue curves are mean values and red are standard deviations added to respectively 
subtracted from mean values. 
The trend of the first momentum in frequency domain has a periodic fluctuations
for the mallware`s target host. Second momentum is
very low for the first 4 fourier coeficient. This properties seems to be unique in 
comparison to other endpoints.


The figures \ref{fig:dens_dst_bdivp},
\ref{fig:dens_src_bdivp}, \ref{fig:dens_dst_logp} and \ref{fig:dens_src_logp} are 
showing an kernel density estimation of the value of first six coeficients.
Before the calculation dataset had been put in scale so that the central mean equals to zero
and standard deviation equals to one. Kernel function is the normal and bandwidth (or smoothing parameter)
is guessed by maximizing likelihood. Curves on figure \ref{fig:loglik_src_bdivp} are showing
the dependency of the likelihood on the bandwidth. Likelihood is computed as a sum of the
logarithms of values of the partial probability density models evaluated on a testing datasets, 
while the model parameters are trained on a training datasets. Both, the testing and 
training datasets are obtained by 5-fold crossvalidation process. %TODO: formulas

Both the first momentum and the second mometum ought to be taken in consideration 
by the anomaly evaluation. The periodic fluctuations as the low are distinct from the
chaotic behavior of the ordinary endpoints. Very low values of second momentum 
as its fluctuations in frequency domain are notable too.

\subsection{Implementation}
Anomaly evaluation based on the values of the second momentum has been implemented 
as a agent for testing purposes in the Camnep intrusion detection system. The programming 
language is Java. Agent receives an statistics from the data geathering agents and is called 
each time the 5-minutes block is received. Matrix $\mathcal{R}^{(1)\bullet}$ is computed. 
Row $\mathcal{R}^{(1)\bullet}_{i,*,e}$ represents a trend of the coeficient $i$ in time domain 
for the particular target endpoint $e$. Standard deviation is then calculated and matrix
$\mathcal{D}^{(1)}_{i,e}$ of the standard deviations is constructed.
For each coeficient $i$ 10th-percentile $t^{(1)}_i$ is calculated over all target endpoints $e$, 
where $t^{(1)}_i$ is a threshold.
Logical matrix $\mathcal{K}^{(1)}_{t,e}$ is then constructed: 
$\mathcal{K}^{(1)}_{i,e} = \mathcal{D}^{(1)}_{i,e} \le t^{(1)}_i $. 
So for 10\% endpoints with least value of $\mathcal{K}^{(1)}$
it contains value 1 otherwise value 0. Weighted average over the sequence $\mathcal{K}^{(1)}_{*,e}$
then outputs the level of anomaly $a_e$ for each target endpoint. Weights are choosen empiricaly
and some results were obtained giving weight of $1$ for coeficients $i \in \{1,2,3,4,5\}$, weight of $0.2$
where $i\in \{6,7,... 20\}$ otherwise weight of $0$.

\section{Conclusion}
The implementation is still under development. Next research ougth to be aimed on the modeling of the
frequency spectrums and the fluctuations. More endpoints ought to be taken in consideration. 

Relation between model and different behaviors of the mallware is also important to be investigated.
